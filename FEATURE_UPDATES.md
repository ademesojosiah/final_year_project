# Feature Updates Implementation

## Summary
This document outlines the three major features implemented in the order management system:

## 1. Role-Based Route Redirection

### Problem
Previously, when users tried to access pages they didn't have permission for, they would see an "Access Denied" page.

### Solution
Updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to intelligently redirect users based on their role:
- **User role** trying to access manager dashboard → Redirected to `/orders`
- **Manager role** trying to access user-only features → Redirected to `/dashboard`

### Code Changes
- **File**: `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Change**: Modified role-based access check to use `Navigate` component for redirection instead of showing access denied message

## 2. Real-Time Order Creation Events

### Problem
The manager dashboard wasn't receiving real-time notifications when new orders were created.

### Solution
Added Socket.IO event listener for `orderCreated` events in the manager dashboard.

### Implementation Details
- **File**: `src/pages/DashboardWithDetails.tsx`
- **New Features**:
  - Socket.IO connection to production backend
  - Real-time listening for `orderCreated` events
  - Automatic addition of new orders to the dashboard
  - Connection status indicator
  - Real-time order updates

### Event Structure
```typescript
interface OrderCreatedEvent {
  orderId: string;
  customerName: string;
  productName: string;
  quantity: number;
  sheetType: string;
  status: string;
  estimatedDate: string;
  timestamp: string;
  message: string;
}
```

## 3. Drag and Drop Functionality

### Problem
Managers couldn't easily move orders backward in the workflow process.

### Solution
Implemented drag and drop functionality using `@dnd-kit` library that allows moving OrderCards to previous statuses only.

### Implementation Details

#### Libraries Added
- `@dnd-kit/core` - Core drag and drop functionality
- `@dnd-kit/sortable` - Sortable components
- `@dnd-kit/utilities` - Utility functions

#### Components Modified

**MainWelcomeDashboardWithDetails.tsx**
- Added `DndContext` wrapper
- Created `DroppableColumn` component for status columns
- Created `DroppableArea` component for drop zones
- Created `DraggableOrderCard` component for draggable cards
- Implemented backward-only movement logic

**OrderCard.tsx**
- Added `isDragging` prop support
- Added visual feedback for dragging state

**DashboardWithDetails.tsx**
- Added drag and drop callback handling
- Added connection status indicator
- Added helpful hint about drag functionality

### Drag and Drop Rules
- Orders can only be moved **backward** to the previous status
- Movement hierarchy: Delivery → Packaging → In Binding → In Printing → In Production
- Real-time API updates when orders are moved
- Visual feedback during drag operations

### Status Flow
```
In Production → In Printing → In Binding → Packaging → Delivery
      ↑             ↑            ↑          ↑         ↑
   (can move to any previous status from current position)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Socket.IO Integration
- **Backend URL**: `https://final-year-project-backend-ubk7.onrender.com`
- **Events Listened**: 
  - `orderCreated` - New order notifications
  - `order-updated` - Order status updates
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and error handling

### API Integration
- **OrdersAPI.updateOrder()** - Updates order status when dragged
- Real-time synchronization with backend
- Error handling for failed updates

### Visual Enhancements
- Connection status indicators
- Drag operation visual feedback
- Drop zone highlighting
- Helpful usage hints

## Testing the Features

### 1. Role Redirection
1. Login as a user (`user@test.com` / `user123`)
2. Try to navigate to `/dashboard`
3. Should automatically redirect to `/orders`

### 2. Real-Time Order Creation
1. Login as manager (`manager@test.com` / `manager123`)
2. Go to manager dashboard
3. Orders created elsewhere will appear in real-time

### 3. Drag and Drop
1. Login as manager
2. Go to dashboard view (not product log)
3. Drag any order card to a previous status column
4. Order should move and update in real-time

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting HTML5 drag and drop
- React 19 compatible
- Socket.IO WebSocket fallback for older browsers

## Notes
- Drag and drop only works for backward movement (preventing workflow violations)
- Real-time updates work across multiple browser sessions
- All changes are persisted to the backend database
- Visual indicators help users understand system status and capabilities
